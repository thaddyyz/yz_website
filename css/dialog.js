                    'This was my first professional experience during my bachelor\'s degree, and I thoroughly enjoyed it due to the unique mix of hardware, software, and cross-cultural collaboration. I worked closely with team members from six different countries, which shaped both my technical growth and professional mindset early on.',
                    'One of my earliest lessons was the importance of quality. I initially believed that my first project—delivering the company\'s first fully functional, automated Hardware-In-Loop (HIL) testing setup for vehicle systems—was well within my capabilities. I even added extra features I thought the team would find valuable, such as remote control functionality so an embedded engineer based in Vietnam could run tests independently. I completed the setup and code within six weeks and was proud of the outcome. However, during my CTO\'s code review, I learned a hard lesson: while the system worked, the code quality was far below industry expectations. I had to rewrite the entire program from scratch. That experience fundamentally changed how I approach engineering—quality, maintainability, and clarity matter just as much as functionality.',
                    'My role at ION Mobility evolved rapidly. As a software intern, I had to pick up new languages and frameworks. As a firmware engineer working on power electronics, I had to understand specialised tools and low-level systems. As a project manager, I had to learn how to communicate clearly across disciplines. As a systems engineer, I needed a working understanding of nearly every subsystem in the vehicle to translate user needs into actionable technical requirements. Each transition exposed how much I did not yet know. I learned that the fastest way to grow was to talk to people, identify my gaps, and actively seek ways to fill them. Learning became less about documentation alone and more about collaboration.',
                    'I also learned how team dynamics can define success. Early on, we were a small development team of seven without a project manager. We delivered, but slowly and inefficiently. When an experienced project manager joined, the transition was difficult—technical leads felt constrained, and engineers struggled to accept direction from someone unfamiliar with their technical challenges. Within six months, he was let go. Later, I was asked to step into a project management role for vehicle systems, despite initially requesting to remain purely a software engineer. I immediately felt the shift—engineers and technical leads I had worked closely with became more guarded. To overcome this, I adopted a collaborative approach: asking instead of directing, spending time understanding constraints, helping with debugging, building tools for engineers, and being present as part of the team rather than above it. Trust took time, but by the point I left, all prioritised features and critical bugs were cleared for the V1 release. I learned that leadership, especially as a young manager among experienced engineers, is earned through empathy, contribution, and consistency—not authority.',
                    'Fourth, I learned about the value of communication: many issues we faced boiled down to communication, which was challenging for 2 reasons, working culture, technical language. I learned to never assume and just be clear what I say, often checking in with product owners and developers on the clarity of expectations and deliverables.',
                    'Finally, I learned about the value of my value. One of the most important lessons came toward the end of my time at ION Mobility. My CEO often told me, "Your job is to put out fires." I interpreted this as finding opportunities to add value wherever possible. In doing so, I identified several systemic issues—how digital keys were managed in production, how fragmented diagnostic tools made fault isolation difficult, and how ineffective bug reporting slowed development. Addressing these became some of my most impactful contributions as a TPM and systems engineer. During my exit interview, however, my CEO surprised me by saying he was disappointed. He explained that my unique value was not just solving these problems, but the holistic understanding I had gained by working at the intersection of engineering teams, manufacturing, and management. That perspective was something only I had—but I never escalated it to him. Reflecting on this, I realised that while solving problems was expected of my role, offering strategic insight was not—and that was the value I failed to fully communicate. It reshaped how I now think about ownership, responsibility, and speaking up.'
